Welcome to my expense tracker repository.

- INTRODUCTION

This web app is currently deployed and it's for personal use. 
However, I wanted to keep the source code free for anyone to see, and I wanted to use this as part of my portfolio (available here in my profile).

I was learning while writing this app some of the nodejs's express framework and mongoDB, aswell as practicing some of my reactJS skills, since I'm very interested in web development.

- ABOUT

The idea of this app came to me since I purchased a taxi at end of 2022, and I needed some easy way to keep track and access all of the incomes and spends generated by it, so I can keep organized my information and this way I can see how much I'm earning or how much I'm spending.
Something pretty basic, but it seemed like a good idea to make this a basic fullstack web app.

Thank you for reading me :)
